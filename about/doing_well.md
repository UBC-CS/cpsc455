How to do well in this course
=======================

## Before the Term

No one is expected to know the material in this course before you start the course. If you know none of the tools/skills we’ll learn this term, that’s OK; indeed, that’s the point!

However, we also expect that registrants will have a wide range of pre-existing skills. That means (once the term starts) someone can probably help you with whatever problem you run into. USE our Slack channel to ask for help, and help others as much as you can! Our participation points encourage this!

## Keeping Up During the Term

This is a project course with extremely hands-on workshops and labs. Be sure that you do the required preparatory work before each workshop (except the first)—which often includes fundamental steps like installation—or fall immediately behind.

Also, be sure to manage progress on your project and communication with your team. Letting work slide to the end of the project will have a tremendous negative impact on your health, well-being, and grade. Letting communication or teamwork issues slide in your group can cause the same. We’ll try to use regular design reviews to give you an opportunity to flag these issues to us and to yourselves.

Please ask us for help when you need it!
