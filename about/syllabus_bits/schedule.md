## Typical 2-week module

A typical 2-week unit starts with the pre-class prep work for that unit's workshop.
The unit then stretches to the next workshop—though we’ll occasionally deviate from this schedule:

| Stage             | Activity                                                                          | Due               |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
