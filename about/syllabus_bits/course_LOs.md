Typically, learning objectives state what you will be able to do.
As we intend this to be an intensely practical course, we instead discuss what you will **have** done upon successfully completing this course:

- applied a variety of current, popular, highly industry-relevant technologies;
- expanded your professional portfolio with compelling, hands-on
- experience working on a complete software project, start to finish;
- applied good communication and collaboration practices in a small-team environment; and
- networked with industry contacts and potential mentors.
