## Learning Materials

There is no requirement to purchase textbooks or any other materials for this course.
However, it may be difficult to complete the course successfully without your own computer. Many of the resources we use are cloud-based; so, lab, library, and other public computers may suffice, but you’ll need to be very careful with your time and planning.
We will require you to register with and use various online resources that may only be available on servers outside Canada. If this is an issue for you, please raise it with the course staff immediately by the end of the first workshop.
For a rundown of likely tools and systems used this term, please see the course schedule.

## Course Schedule
