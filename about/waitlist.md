# Waitlist Policies

**Waitlisted** students: Be sure to participate fully in the course to maintain your standing, and be ready to be flexible with your project group assignment.

<!-- 
**Standing on the waitlist**: Students on the waitlist will be considered for admission to CPSC 455 in the order normally set by the CPSC department **except** waitlisted students who do not attend the first workshop (May 11) or are substantially late will be removed from the waitlist without the opportunity to join the course, and we may consider lab availability when deciding if students can be moved off of the waitlist.
-->

**Waitlisted students in project groups**: We may form project groups entirely from waitlisted students or by replacing students who dropped from existing teams, but we are unlikely to provide free choice of group to waitlisted students.
