Our course builds on the [department's academic integrity statement](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/resources/academic-integrity) with additional rules designed to create a professional but collaborative environment.

For **group submissions**:

- Group submissions are the joint effort of your group. We place no specific limits on your collaboration except where we explicitly ask you to document and discuss it (Scrum updates, peer evaluations, individual components of presentations/reports, etc.). Collaborate productively so that everyone learns!
- The majority of your project should be yours, as a group. However, we encourage you to find help and resources, as you would in a professional setting! Where you use or adapt existing code, you must cite it and be cognizant of its license. Where you get help from others, you must acknowledge that help. (This is especially critical for classmates, as it may benefit their participation grade!) Citations/acknowledgments should be in a clear section in your main README.md, in your license (if you have one!), and repeated locally where you used the code/help.
- Critically, be able to justify and explain your design: no piece should be obscure to your group as a whole, and little should be obscure to any individual team member.

For **individual submissions**:

<!-- - Keep your repository for your individual assignment private until after the assignment's deadline, at which time change it to public for grading purposes. -->
- Except where a tutorial used for the assignment guides you to do so, do not copy-paste code. Ask for help only from course staff or in “public venues” from fellow students: during lab or workshops or on public Slack channels. Otherwise, ensure you follow the group submission guidelines for citation and acknowledgment!
- Critically, be able to justify and explain all of your design.

We hope these rules encourage collaboration that helps you learn. Please inform us if you find they are imposing unreasonable limits on your work!
