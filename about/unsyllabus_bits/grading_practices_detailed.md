The grading scheme for this course is:

| Item             | Weight        | Due date(s)     |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Team Project     | 50% (5 x 8%)  | Bi-monthly      |
| Lab Assignments  | 30% (6 x 5%)  | TBD             |
| Participation    | 11% (11 x 1%) | Weekly          |
| Teamwork         | 9% (2 x 4.5%) | TBD             |

```{attention}
Our expectation is that all team members will contribute substantially to the project, and will be scored by both the participation and teamwork components.
In cases of lower contributions, the final project mark for individuals may also be impacted.
```

```{note}
The bi-monthly workshops are essential for this course and students must be present for all workshops.
Students must have extensive consultations with the course staff in advance of an absolutely unmissable pre-planned absence such as a wedding, funeral, birth of a child, etc. 

During these consultations, students may be recommended to withdraw from the course if the teaching team feels the absence would be too disruptive.
