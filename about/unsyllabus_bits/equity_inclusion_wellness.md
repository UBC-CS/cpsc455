The CS Department has a fantastic [statement on Equity, Inclusion, and Wellness](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/resources/equity-inclusion-wellness) with a large number of resource links available, for example if you have concerns or needs for accommodation.

We hope that all of us in the CPSC 455 also create a welcoming, respectful, inclusive, and positive environment.
While the course is unlikely to be stress-free (because learning and projects are hard work, and hard work is often stressful), we also hope you will not find the course overwhelming.
You may have ideas, questions, or concerns about creating such an environment in the course; we may make a mistake; or we may just plain do something wrong.
If any of that happens, please let someone know.
Talk to one of us on the course staff if you’re comfortable or to someone from the link above (or the Head or Undergraduate Associate Head of the department) if you’re not.
