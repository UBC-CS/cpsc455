Credit for the creation of this course goes largely to contributions by:

- Danya Karras, UBC Alum, D2L Software Engineering Manager
- Ian McLean, UBC Alum, D2L Sr. dev
- Stephanie Mah, UBC Alum, Produce8 Software Developer
- Steve Wolfman, UBC Professor of Teaching

<!-- While completing her Physics degree, Danya realized she loved building things with code, and entered the BCS program. On the side, she fueled her passion for education by teaching piano, ballet, and Ukrainian Folk Dance. Combining all of her skills, Danya now has a job in Ed Tech, and has a side job (this course) in Tech Ed. As an Engineering Manager at D2L, Danya continues to be a champion for learning by hosting demos, volunteering at tech events, and convincing others to join her in building cool things. -->

<!-- Ian was destined to cure Ebola, until Grade 11 biology class introduced him to Charlie Darwin, and set him on a confusing path to study Evolution and Ecology at SFU(BSc) and Carleton(MSc). Though he loved biology, Ian didn’t have the patience for the theoretical/academic life, and so he stopped his biology studies, and tried to get a job (for which he was mainly under- or over-qualified for). Finally, Ian found his way to LifeLabs, and realized that he wanted a life with biology and tech combined. He then promptly moved back to BC, and bothered the BCS program until they let him in. Ian is currently a dormant biologist, learning how to be a software developer at D2L, and trying to help cool stuff happen (like this class). -->

<!-- Following a lengthy educational journey from electrical engineering to fashion design to business, Stephanie ultimately decided to return to her passion for programming after finally getting a BCom. Since graduating from the BCS program, Stephanie has honed her full-stack skills at startup PAI Health, Paybyphone, Rivian, and now Produce8. When she’s not working, she spends her time on one of her too many hobbies: drawing, baking, learning languages or gaming, to name a few. -->
