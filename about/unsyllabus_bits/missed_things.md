**Emergencies**: If you’re ill or an accident or emergency occurs, contact the course staff and your group ASAP to let them know at least that you will be or did miss because of an emergency. Follow-up with the course staff with enough details for us to be able to accommodate your absence in terms of grades. Expect to put in a lot of work to make up the missed time!

**Planned absences from workshops**: If you will miss a single workshop in the term because of scheduling conflicts, communicate that to the course staff RIGHT AWAY and by at least a week before the add/drop deadline. We may be able to accommodate that. Also be sure your group knows once you’ve formed a group. If you will miss two or more workshops, you should drop the course. That’s the equivalent of missing four weeks of lecture in a regular course that has mandatory lecture attendance and is NOT ACCEPTABLE. See rubric for absences here.

**Planned absences from labs**: If you have to miss a small number of labs over the term for good reasons, we should be able to accommodate that. Be sure to let us and your group know in advance. If possible, we may want you to attend the other day’s lab.

**Planned absence from final showcase**: Treat this like missing two or more workshops (as discussed above) or a course’s final exam. You should likely DROP THE COURSE.

Contact us privately on Slack (preferred) or at cpsc455-staff@cs.ubc.ca in all of these cases. If you contact us on Slack, please add ALL course instructors (Ian and Firas) to your Slack chat.
