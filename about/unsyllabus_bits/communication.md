Course communication will be a combination of face-to-face and on Zoom (in workshops, labs, and your team meetings), via our course website, on GitHub, or on Slack.

Slack is an industry-standard communication tool for teams, and learning to use it is a course goal! Indeed, participation on Slack will factor into your participation grade for the course. As a rule, we prefer even private correspondence to go over Slack. (You and your group may have a primary Slack point-of-contact on the course staff assigned to you.)

Our preferred mode of communication is: Create a single chat with all course instructors (Ian and Firas), and send your message there. We will get back to you there.

```{tip}
**DO NOT MESSAGE US INDIVIDUALLY** ; we will just direct you to send a message to all instructors.
```

Note that Slack does store information on non-Canadian servers. So, if you wish to contact the course staff on a sensitive or private topic, please e-mail cpsc455-staff@cs.ubc.ca.

We may also occasionally communicate with you via your @ugrad.cs.ubc.ca e-mail alias or the e-mail address registered for you at the UBC student service centre. Be sure to check both addresses or forward them to somewhere you check.

Finally, we may require some additional communication mechanisms as the term goes on, such as LinkedIn.
