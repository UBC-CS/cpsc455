# Assignment 06

Submit this assignment by adding your document (PDF format) to your existing assignment repo (can be either on an "Assignment6" branch or added to the main branch).

## Resume

For the sixth, and final assignment, you’ll be creating a job resume. This will be based on content presented during the sixth workshop. We understand that many of you may have an existing resume, so this is a great chance to either create a brand new one, or take your existing resume, and modify/update it. 

We’re expecting the following:

1. 1 page MAX!

1. Your name and contact details

1. At least three sections that cover: 
- Education
- Work experience (try your best to use examples that would be relevant to a tech-related  job)
- Technical skills/experience + Side projects

1. Your project from this course!

1. It should be a PDF.

You should be ready to show your resume to a TA during your first week lab, and should be ready to answer questions about it.

HAVE FUN!!!
