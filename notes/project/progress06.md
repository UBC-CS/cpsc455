# Progress 6

```{tip}
Advice: Spend some time ASAP with your group deciding what functionality/goals you plan to complete over the last <4 weeks. Divide the goals into bite-sized chunks, and make concrete plans to incrementally tackle each part. Wrap up the major functionality of your app.

## Project Requirements:

There are 3 things you need to prepare!

### Project Demo

Prepare your demo! Read the rubric really carefully, and use it as a guide in planning your presentation. The Industry Judges will be using a pared-down version of the rubric, but course staff will be using this [exact rubric](https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~cs-455/2024_S/about/rubrics.html#final-project-presentation).

All members should be ready to present, and you should try to highlight the strengths (especially anything cool or outside-of-the-box) of your completed project!

You will have a chance to practice your demos in the second week of labs (Saturday and Tuesday), but keep in mind that is right before the final presentation! Be prepared to watch other group demos and give feedback.

### Project Documentation

You will need to update your README before the final due date. This will help us in grading your final project, as well as provide information for anyone who views your project code (recruiter, interviewer). The [Final Project Rubric](https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~cs-455/2024_S/about/rubrics.html#final-project-submission) will be used to grade both your report, and your project code. 

### Project Code/App

Prepare your code! Attempt to wrap up any in-progress goals, and spend time on bug fixing. Once again, [read the rubric](https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~cs-455/2024_S/about/rubrics.html#final-project-submission) very carefully to see exactly how youâ€™ll be graded.

## How to hand in:

When you are ready, create a branch titled `final_project`. Push your finalized code to that branch.
Do not push to this branch after the due date: Noon (12PM PT) on Wednesday August 7th.
