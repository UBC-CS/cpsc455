# Progress 5

```{tip}
Advice: Spend some time ASAP with your group deciding what functionality/goals you plan to complete over the last <4 weeks. Divide the goals into bite-sized chunks, and make concrete plans to incrementally tackle each part. Wrap up the major functionality of your app.
```

## Project Requirements:

Must be completed with your group before workshop 6.

- Deploy your project using GitHub Actions! 
    - Course staff are familiar with Heroku (and should be covered in assignment 5), but you may host it elsewhere if you wish.
- Add a [workflow status badge](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/adding-a-workflow-status-badge) in your README file
- Attempt to complete ALL of your remaining standard goals. If you cannot finish some of the goals by the next workshop, explain why they are not achievable, or give your plan for completing them before the final presentations.
- Write a quick, 2-3 sentence high-level description of your project for someone who has never seen your project before, and put it at the top of your README. This will go to the industry guests, so please make sure that it is suitable for posting publicly. (Sell your web app!)
- Read through the final project rubric [Sections 7 and 8](https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~cs-455/2024_S/about/rubrics.html#final-project-presentation) and ensure that you are currently meeting all the requirements (or plan to work on them soon)

```{tip}
**Remember**: These requirements are very minimal and are here to make sure that you are making forward progress on the project. We encourage you to make progress beyond the requirements in order to create an awesome project!
```

## How to hand in:

When you are ready, create a branch titled â€œproject_5. Push your finalized code to that branch. 
Do not push to this branch after 10AM PT on the day of Workshop 6.
