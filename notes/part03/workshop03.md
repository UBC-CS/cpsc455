# Workshop 3: Saturday June 8, 2024

Below are the slides from today's class embedded and [linked here]().

## Pre-Workshop Tasks

Your pre-workshop work will ensure that you're set up for our in-class activities this Saturday!
It should take about 5 minutes (or less), and if you do get stuck, ask your TAs in lab, or post in the #workshop-3 channel. 

1. Install node if you havenâ€™t already. You should already have it though.
2. Create a new folder for your backend server and cd into it, run `npx express-generator --no-view`
3. This will setup a basic express application that we will work from during the workshop.
4. Run an `npm install && npm run start` to start the express application.
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to ensure that it is running.
6. (Optional) Install Postman.
7. (Optional) Familiarize yourself with this repo. This will be the frontend that will be used during class.

That's it !
