# Lab 1B

In this lab, TAs will be working with students to grade labs individually in breakout rooms.

## Lab Grading

There will be a message in Slack that students can reply to in order to sign up for the grading queue. Ensure that your Zoom name matches the name you used to reply on Slack.

Students should have the following three things ready **BEFORE** a TA starts grading:

- Code ready to show
- Website/assignment ready to demo
- Terminal/Command prompt/Bash ready to show your branch + latest commits (`git log`)

While this is happening, students should be working in their groups on project work. There will be an extra breakout room available for groups to use.

Everyone should have a group by now. If you are still looking for a group to join, talk to a TA as soon as possible.
