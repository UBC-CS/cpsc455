# Assignment 4

## Team Member Website... Continued Again!

For the fourth assignment, you’ll be adding more functionality to your team member website, now with MongoDB! It will build on the previous assignment, so start from your completed assignment 3, and begin to incorporate the requirements below. We hope you'll find this assignment somewhat smaller in scope than the previous one. We expect you'll start putting less time into assignments and more into the project starting at this point in the term.

We’re expecting the following:

1. You MUST use MongoDB (Atlas is a good choice for both assignment/project), and start your assignment from your completed assignment 3. Remember, you will be asked to explain sections of your code. (Mongoose is not required, but it can be useful.)

2. Think about how you would like to organize the data in your DB
- You must have the member name, description, age (or whatever numerical thing you had), and image location..
- You must have at LEAST one other piece of data. Ex.
    - Additional member details/specifics?
    - Other data?

3. Set up your DB Collection(s) to store this data

4. When you add new members, they should be added to your database. You should be able to refresh the page, or even restart your server, and your data should persist!

5. Ability to delete an individual member(and it should be removed from the database).

6. Additional functionality (directly related to MongoDB) of your choice. Examples could be:
- Editing an existing member
- Filtering data from the DB
- Getting additional details for a member(stored in the same collection)
- Getting additional details for a member(stored in a different collection!)

```{note}
Note: You do NOT need to maintain all of your functionality from the previous assignments, as long as you are meeting the requirements above. However, make sure you still have all the other technologies of the assignment, including React & Redux, Express, and Node! You shouldn’t need to make drastic changes to your existing code.
```

As described in the individual assignment rubric, your code will need to meet these requirements and be functional, up to perhaps a few minor glitches in tricky cases. Note that functionality includes both user-visible and console-visible issues.

You should be ready to demo this to a TA during your second week lab, and should be ready to answer questions about it, as well as explain what you’ve done.

It’s up to you! We’re hoping that you’ll use the above requirements as a guide, but that you’ll let your imagination take over, and build something unique and interesting!

HAVE FUN!!!
