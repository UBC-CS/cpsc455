# Workshop 5: Saturday July 13, 2024

We are going to do something slightly different for Workshop 5 - the Saturday session will be structured slightly differently, but we'll be starting at 10 AM as usual and **you will need to watch an asynchronous recording** as preparation.
There will be two aspects to this workshop:

1. Theoretical Portion (Asynchronous Video)
2. Practical Portion (Live on Saturday)

The theoretical portion will be presented by an industry expert (Dorothy Ordogh) and a practically crash course on GitHub Actions for deployment from one of your course instructors.

## Theoretical Portion (Asynchronous Video)

Here is a recorded video (click the image) from Dorothy from last year:

The password for the video recording will be shared with you on Slack.
