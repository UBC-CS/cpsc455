# Lab 5B

In this lab, TAs will be working with students to grade labs individually in breakout rooms.

## Lab Grading

There will be a message in Slack that students can reply to in order to sign up for the grading queue. Ensure that your Zoom name matches the name you used to reply on Slack.

Students should have the following three things ready **BEFORE** a TA starts grading:

- Code ready to show
- Website/assignment ready to demo
- Terminal/Command prompt/Bash ready to show your branch + latest commits (`git log`)

We're hoping to spend approximately 10 minutes on grading, which will be divided into:

- 3-5 minutes of demo: You’ll show us your code and functioning website (with all the required functionality), answer questions as you go, and take direction from course staff.
- 3-5 minutes of Q&A: You’ll answer 3 questions related to your assignment and the workshop material to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding. These questions are not meant to be overly difficult. Review the workshop slides and ensure you are following the best practices outlined there or in Slack, and you should do fine.

You can refer to the rubric on the assignment to see how everything is broken down.

## Project Work

While this is happening, students should be working in their groups on project work. There will be an extra breakout room available for groups to use.
